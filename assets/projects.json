This helped the QA teams to get extra time for other testings and learnings."

This made sure the tasks are completed on the said timeline and no delays are caused. \n There are multiple services which give a functionality of mock server creation / mock api creation. However, so that we don't have to save our company api's anywhere, I had come up witha plan to create a Mock server inside our company Postman workspace. This made sure the api's are secure enough."
